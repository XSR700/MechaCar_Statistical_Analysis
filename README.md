## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The variables/coefficients that provided the most non-random amount of variance was when comparing MPG with vehicle length. The image below represents the statistical analysis and linear regression graph of MPG vs. Vehicle Length. this variable showed the lowest p-value (0.0000026).

Based on the graph the slope of the linear model is not considered zero. 


given the p-value we can reject the null hypothesis and say that there is statistically significant propobility that vehicle length does have an effect on vehicle mpg. 


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Based on the image of statistical results below, we see that the PSI variance is 62.3 across all lots. This falls below the required 100 PSI vaiance and meets the MechaCar suspension specification.

The next image shows the statistical summary of each individual lots. The results are ordered lot 1, lot 2, and lot 3 respectfully. The 4th row describes the PSI variance of each lot. Lots 1 & 2 show very little variance. Lot 1 seems to have the least variance with 0.98. However lot 3 has a PSI variance of 170.29 and does not meet the MechaCar suspension specification.
