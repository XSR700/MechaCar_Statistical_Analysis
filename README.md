## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The variables/coefficients that provided the most non-random amount of variance was when comparing MPG with vehicle length. The image below represents the statistical analysis and linear regression graph of MPG vs. Vehicle Length. this variable showed the lowest p-value (0.0000026).

Based on the graph the slope of the linear model is not considered zero. 


given the p-value we can reject thr null hypothesis and say that there is statistically significant propobility that vehicle length does have an effect on vehicle mpg.
